### Emerging Markets | Power BI & Excel | Strategy & Execution

# 🚀 Project Context
This project simulates the work of an **APM Analyst at dLocal,** supporting the **Head of APMs** with data-driven insights to expand, optimize, and scale Alternative Payment Methods across emerging markets.
Using:
-	A **10,000-transaction Excel dataset**
-	A **5-page Power BI executive dashboard**
I evaluated **APM performance, adoption, conversion efficiency, and failure patterns** across multiple countries and payment types, translating analytics into **clear strategic actions.**

# 🎯 Business Objectives (Aligned to dLocal Role)
-	Identify high-performing and underperforming APMs
-	Diagnose conversion leakage across authorization → completion
-	Support APM launch, optimization, and prioritization decisions
-	Provide stakeholder-ready insights for product, commercial, and operations teams

# 🔢 Overall Performance (Excel-Derived)

|Metric                         |Value
:------------------------------:|:---------------------
Total Transactions	            |  10,000
Authorization Rate	            |  78.3%
Completion Rate	                |  71.5%
Average Transaction Value	      |  $152.09

### Insight:
A ~7% drop between authorization and completion signals post-authorization friction, a critical APM optimization opportunity.

# 💳 Performance by Payment Method
|Payment Method	      |Transactions	    |Auth Rate	    |Completion Rate	    |Avg Value ($)
:--------------------:|:---------------:|:-------------:|:-------------------:|:--------------
Bank Transfer	          2,056	            76.6%	          72.4%	                152.89
Card	                  2,038	            78.0%	          71.8%	                153.78
Mobile Wallet	          1,998	            79.7%	          71.0%	                149.26
QR Payments	2,000	78.2%	71.4%	152.30
USSD	1,908	79.4%	70.6%	152.16
APM Insight:
•	USSD & Mobile Wallets show strong authorization → adoption signal
•	Completion drop-off is consistent across APMs → systemic UX or timeout issue, not method-specific
